#Applied Bayesian Statistics
This repository consist of a compendium of assignments and their respective solutions for an advanced course in Applied Bayesian Statistics. It imparts a comprehensive understanding of theoretical, computational, and practical aspects of the Bayesian statistics.
Throughout the course, the following topics are covered in-depth:
  - A contrastive examination of Bayesian and frequentist methodologies
  - Bayesian learning paradigms
  - Commonly employed prior distributions
  - Techniques for succinctly summarizing posterior distributions
 
Furthermore, the course delves into modern Bayesian computational algorithms, primarily Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, executed through the Python/R programming languages. The central subjects covered in this segment include:
  - Monte Carlo approximations
  - Gibbs sampling
  - Diagnostics for convergence evaluation
  - Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS)

Armed with these computational tools, participants will engage in the application of Bayesian methodologies to a variety of data analysis problems, including but not limited to:
  - Multivariate linear regression
  - Generalized linear models
  - Hierarchical modeling
  - Surrogate models
  - Gaussian Proccess

Throughout the course, comparative model evaluation and model adequacy testing are emphasized as fundamental components of Bayesian statistics. Through this course, one will attain a comprehensive understanding of these concepts and the ability to implement them in real-world scenarios.
